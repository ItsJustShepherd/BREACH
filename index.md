## Welcome to The BREACH GitHub Page.
Here you'll find developer notes regarding BREACH though I do suggest you see [The War Room](https://github.com/users/ItsJustShepherd/projects/2/views/1?visibleFields=%5B%22Title%22%2C%22Assignees%22%2C3717491%2C%22Repository%22%2C%22Labels%22%2C%22Status%22%5D&sortedBy%5Bdirection%5D=asc&sortedBy%5BcolumnId%5D=Status) to maintain a more valid and up to date listing, as below are just broad developer notes and outlined roadmap.
