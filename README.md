This is a tool kit orientated towards supporting whitehats and CyberSec enthusiasts.<br>
  The B.R.E.A.C.H (BEGIN, RECON, <i>and</i>, ECHO, ACTIVE, CONFLICT, HARBRINGER)<br>kit is aiming to hand-hold you through all your pre-active enagement needs, such as:<br>
‚Ä¢ DNS Lookup. <br>
‚Ä¢ Git Commit Crawling.
‚Ä¢ Name server records. <br>
‚Ä¢ Trace routing. <br>
‚Ä¢ Auto-curling. <br>
‚Ä¢ Auto-port scanning. <br>
‚Ä¢ Robot.txt, Sitemap.xml checks. <br>
‚Ä¢ Mobile Lookup. <br>
‚Ä¢ Email Lookup. <br>
‚Ä¢ ProtonVPN Interaction. (<i>If configured</i>) <br>
‚Ä¢ BREACH can also 'call' on SCARAB and CICADA. (<i>If configured</i>) <br>
BREACH is the pre-engagement assistance part of the 3-tools I maintain, these being <i>BREACH, SCARAB and CICADA</i>.<br>
<i>If you want to contribute towards it just as others in the CyberSec Communities have, just get in touch through Discord.
